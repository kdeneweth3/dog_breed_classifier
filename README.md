# Dog Breed Classifier

This project creates a dog breed classifier that can identify 133 different dog breeds.
The data set is relatively small at 8,000 images.

First, it's shown how a poor a simple CNN performs... spoiler accuracy is only 7%.
Next, transfer learning is leveraged using the ResNet 50 model. By only adding a global pooling and a fully
connected layer, 81% accuracy is achieved... woot woot.
